# Clg-Website-Dev

In today’s  fast and competitive world, a university’s first  face is it’s website. If some unknown wants to know about a university, they would first look into its website. Our Project is creating a website for VIT Bhopal. We want to modify the original VIT Bhopal website with some more extra features making it more attractive. As a process of knowing what changes are to be made in the website, we mainly thought of few important ideas –
       1. Live Chat System
       2. VIT G-Pay
       3. Attractive homepage
       4. No empty spaces in the website
Team alpha (Team of 4) Individual Contribution Mounish – 18BCE10187 Mounish has developed the designing of homepage, the footer part of the contact info and the live chat system.
